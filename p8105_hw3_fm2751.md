## Problem 0

Public GitHub repo, local R Project, subdirectory for data, and .Rmd
file created and rendered to github_document.

## Problem 1

### Read in the data

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

### Answer questions about the data

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
resprenting a single product from an instacart order. Variables include
identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which each
product was added to the cart. There are several order-level variables,
describing the day and time of the order, and number of days since prior
order. Then there are several item-specific variables, describing the
product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs,
produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item
has been ordered by this user in the past. In total, there are 39123
products found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.

Below is a table summarizing the number of items ordered from aisle. In
total, there are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits
holding the most items ordered by far.

``` r
  instacart %>% 
    count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

Next is a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle.
Here, aisles are ordered by ascending number of items.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

Our next table shows the three most popular items in aisles
`baking ingredients`, `dog food care`, and `packaged vegetables fruits`,
and includes the number of times each item is ordered in your table. \*
In `packaged vegetables fruits`, the three most popular items are
Organic Baby Spinach (9784), Organic Raspberries (5546), and Organic
Blueberries (4966); \* In `baking ingredients`, the three most popular
items are Light Brown Sugar (499), Pure Baking Soda (387), and Cane
Sugar (336); \* In `dog food care`, the three most popular items are
Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats (30), Organix Chicken &
Brown Rice Recipe (28), and Small Dog Biscuits (26).

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

Finally is a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. This
table has been formatted in an untidy manner for human readers. Pink
Lady Apples are generally purchased slightly earlier in the day than
Coffee Ice Cream, with the exception of day 5.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_hour) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

## Problem 2

### Load and tidy the data

``` r
accel = 
  read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv", col_types = cols()) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_prefix = "activity_",
    names_to = "time_in_mins",
    values_to = "activity_counts") %>% 
  mutate(
    time_in_mins = as.numeric(time_in_mins),
    week = as.factor(week),
    day = factor(day, levels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")),
    weekday_vs_weekend  = ifelse(day %in% c("Sunday", "Saturday"), print("weekend"), print("weekday"))) %>%
  arrange(day)
```

    ## [1] "weekend"
    ## [1] "weekday"

#### Description of the resulting dataset

The resulting dataset `accel` contains 50400 observations and 6
variables, they are: week, day_id, day, time_in_mins, activity_counts,
weekday_vs_weekend. It’s worth pointing out that activity time is
recorded in minutes, and we added a new variable `weekday_vs_weekend` to
the original dataset to indicate whether the day is a weekday or a
weekend, which can be very helpful in the following analyses.

### Generate a table of total activity/day

``` r
tot_act <-
  accel %>% 
  group_by(day_id) %>% 
  summarise(total_activity = sum(activity_counts))
tot_act %>% knitr::kable()
```

| day_id | total_activity |
|-------:|---------------:|
|      1 |      480542.62 |
|      2 |       78828.07 |
|      3 |      376254.00 |
|      4 |      631105.00 |
|      5 |      355923.64 |
|      6 |      307094.24 |
|      7 |      340115.01 |
|      8 |      568839.00 |
|      9 |      295431.00 |
|     10 |      607175.00 |
|     11 |      422018.00 |
|     12 |      474048.00 |
|     13 |      423245.00 |
|     14 |      440962.00 |
|     15 |      467420.00 |
|     16 |      685910.00 |
|     17 |      382928.00 |
|     18 |      467052.00 |
|     19 |      371230.00 |
|     20 |      381507.00 |
|     21 |      468869.00 |
|     22 |      154049.00 |
|     23 |      409450.00 |
|     24 |        1440.00 |
|     25 |      260617.00 |
|     26 |      340291.00 |
|     27 |      319568.00 |
|     28 |      434460.00 |
|     29 |      620860.00 |
|     30 |      389080.00 |
|     31 |        1440.00 |
|     32 |      138421.00 |
|     33 |      549658.00 |
|     34 |      367824.00 |
|     35 |      445366.00 |

### Generate a plot of total activity/day to see if any trend present

``` r
tot_act %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day_id, y = total_activity)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs (
    title = "Total activity over each day",
    x = "Day_id",
    y = "Total activity"
  ) +
  theme_classic()
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_fm2751_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />
\* According to the above table and plot generated from the `accel`
dataset, when we focus on the total activity for each day (i.e.,
`total_activity` vs. `day_id`), there is no any apparent trends
observed. We might need to focus on different groupings to observe an
apparent trend.
